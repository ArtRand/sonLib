#sonLib

This is the README for **sonLib**, a (very) compact C/Python library 
for sequence analysis in bioinformatics.

For basic data-structures in C it contains: 

 * array lists (automatically resizing) 
 * hashes
 * sorted sets (backed by an AVL tree)
 * containers (for putting primitives into the above data-structures)
 * better string functions
 * simple exception mechanism
 * logging functions 

For bioinformatic data-structures it contains (or will contain):

 * Fasta I/O functions
 * MAF I/O functions
 * Newick tree I/O functions

For more details see the Full README in doc/README
